**A project developed by Kevin Jing, Christoper Merino, and Pablo Tayun for the 2020 Scope Hackathon**

## Description
2020 has been a rough year for all of us. So, to help lift our spirits, we decided to make Global Memology. Global Memology is a website that's designed to share the joy of memes from across the world. No matter where you are located, you can see the funniest of memes from any place on Earth. Not only does this turn that frown upside down, it also brings the global community together around the most potent remedy, laughter.
